### 1. Start Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### 2. API Endpoints Available
```
POST   /api/team-battle/create          # Create new battle
GET    /api/team-battle/active          # Get user's active battle
GET    /api/team-battle/:code           # Get battle by code
POST   /api/team-battle/:code/join      # Join battle
DELETE /api/team-battle/:id/leave       # Leave battle
```

## 🎮 Key Features

### ✅ Point-Based Scoring
- Each problem has custom points (default 100)
- Winner = team with most points
- Draw if tied when time expires

### ✅ Smart Polling
```javascript
if (numPlayers <= numProblems) {
  // Fetch player submissions (numPlayers API calls)
} else {
  // Fetch contest standings (fewer API calls)
}
```

### ✅ API Rate Limiting
- All CF API calls queued through `cfApiQueue.service.js`
- 1 second minimum between requests
- 10-second caching
- Automatic fallback

### ✅ No Rating Changes
- Team battles don't affect user ELO

### ✅ Flexible Teams
- 1-4 players per team
- Auto-balanced team assignment
- Creator can move players

## 📊 Scoring Example

**Problems:**
- Problem A: 100 pts → Team A solves first
- Problem B: 200 pts → Team B solves first  
- Problem C: 300 pts → Team A solves first

**Result:**
- Team A: 400 points **WINNER** 🏆
- Team B: 200 points

## 📝 Frontend TODO

Now you need to update the frontend:

1. **Navigation** - Add "Team Battle" option in duel mode dropdown
2. **Create Page** - UI to configure and create battles
3. **Join Page** - Enter battle code to join
4. **Room Page** - Waiting room with player slots
5. **Battle Page** - Live battle UI with timer, problems, scores
6. **Results Page** - Show final scores and winner

See `TEAM_BATTLE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for detailed frontend integration guide with React code examples.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test Backend** - Use Postman or curl to test HTTP endpoints
2. **Test Socket.IO** - Use socket.io-client to test events
3. **Build Frontend** - Integrate with React/Vue/etc
4. **Deploy** - Deploy to production when ready
